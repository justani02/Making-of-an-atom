# Making of an atom

The problem is about determining the final number of particles in an atom in a utopian realm where each atom is composed of either electrons or protons. If both an electron and a proton exist in the atom, they disappear until the atom becomes stable. The task is to process a binary string representing the charges in the atom and return the count of particles remaining after eliminating electron-proton pairs.

### Problem statement

In utopia, God is making an atom. Each atom consists of N particles, where an electron is represented by a '0' charge and a proton by a '1'.In utopia, opposites do not exist, and no electron-proton can stay in 1 atom.

In this realm, an atom can be composed of only electrons or protons. If both an electron and proton exist in the atom, the two will disappear. This keeps on happening until the atom becomes stable.

Return the final number of particles in the given atom.

Input Format:
First line contains an integer n, the number of particles Second line contains a binary string

Output Format:
Print an Integer, the number of particles in the atom

---
Sample Input 0:
8 11101111 

Sample Output 0
6 

One electron disappears with 1 proton, leaving the final size of the atom to be 6.
